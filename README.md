## Overview

![screenshot](/screenshot.png)

This is React project, inspired by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) where users can create and delete posts. 
I created and deployed [Fake REST API](https://github.com/boryana-k/fake-server-blog-posts) and created a database for storing posts data (heading, text and author).
This project helped me for learning more about React components & routing, state management, async code, built-in & custom hooks.
